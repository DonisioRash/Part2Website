                <p>
                    Folklore is our cultural DNA. It includes the art, stories, knowledge, and practices of a people. 
                    While folklore can be bound up in memory and histories, folklore is also tied to vibrant living traditions and creative expression today.
                    Folklore covers a wide range of topics, including issues in the news, such as fake news, cryptozoology, legends, holidays, internet memes, traditional and world music, and the supernatural.
                    Folklorists are active in all areas of our society, studying topics such as education, healthcare, poverty, and immigration.
